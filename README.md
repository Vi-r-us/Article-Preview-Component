# Article Preview Component

I created an Article Preview Component featuring a modern UI design that adapts to various screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). To ensure responsiveness, I utilized both flex and grid layouts combined with media queries. Additionally, I enhanced the loading experience with webkit animations and explored implementing the onClick functionality of a button without JavaScript, using labels and checkboxes.

## Overview

### The challenge

During this project, I encountered several challenges, including managing different images for desktop and mobile views. To address this challenge, I employed media queries for image selection. I also explored a unique approach to implement the onClick functionality of a button using only HTML and CSS, utilizing labels and checkboxes.
